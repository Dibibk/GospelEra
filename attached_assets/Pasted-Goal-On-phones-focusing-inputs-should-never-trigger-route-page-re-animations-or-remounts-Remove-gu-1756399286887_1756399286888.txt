Goal
On phones, focusing inputs should never trigger route/page re-animations or remounts. Remove/guard any AnimatePresence, route keys, or tab keys that cause unmount/mount on focus or keyboard resize. Keep animations on desktop.

Do this (apply to all form screens: Post, Prayer, Edit Profile, Contact):

Page transitions

Locate any page wrappers using AnimatePresence, motion.*, or custom transition components around form pages.

For mobile viewports (≤768px):

Bypass exit/enter animations for form routes.

Render the form route directly (no key prop on the route container).

Keep lightweight opacity only on inner, non-conditional containers if needed.

Remove remount keys

Remove key={route}, key={pathname}, key={tab}, or key={windowHeight} props from any parent of the form subtree. These force remounts when keyboard opens/resizes.

Ensure tabs/nav do not conditionally render the entire form subtree on focus.

Guard conditionals

If there’s code like if (keyboardOpen) return <CompactView/>; → do not swap component trees while an input is focused. Render the same tree; only adjust styles.

Sticky layout

Prefer position: sticky for headers/footers; avoid position: fixed that can jitter with the keyboard.

Keep the scrollable region as the page content, not the whole app container.

Concrete examples (apply equivalently where found):

- <AnimatePresence mode="wait">
-   {isFormRoute && <FormPage key={pathname} />}
- </AnimatePresence>
+ {/* Mobile: no page-level animation for form routes */}
+ {isFormRoute && <FormPage />}

- <motion.main key={tab} initial={{opacity:0}} animate={{opacity:1}} exit={{opacity:0}}>
+ <motion.main /* no key on mobile */ initial={{opacity:1}} animate={{opacity:1}}>
    {children}
  </motion.main>

- <FormWrapper key={window.innerHeight}> ... </FormWrapper>
+ <FormWrapper> ... </FormWrapper>


Acceptance

Focus any input on phone: no flicker, no route animation, values persist while typing and on rotate.

Navigating away/back does not lose in-progress form state.
