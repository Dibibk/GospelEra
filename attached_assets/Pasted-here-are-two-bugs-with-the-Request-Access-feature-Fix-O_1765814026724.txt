here are two bugs with the “Request Access” feature.
Fix ONLY these issues and do NOT change anything else in the project.

🧩 Problem 1 – Settings page (Link Share)

On the Settings page, the “Request Access” button for link sharing is not working.

When I tap/click it, nothing useful happens (no request is sent, no confirmation, no proper navigation).

Expected behavior:

When the user taps the “Request Access” button in Settings:

It should trigger the existing Request Access flow that the app is already designed for (e.g., call an API, open a form/modal, or send a request to the backend).

The user should get a clear confirmation (for example: a toast, alert, or inline message) that the request was sent or handled successfully.

If there is an error, show a simple error message instead of failing silently.

🧩 Problem 2 – Create Post page

On the Create Post page, the “Request Access” link gives an error (screenshot attached in my notes).

When I click it, instead of following the correct Request Access flow, it shows an error state/page.

Expected behavior:

The “Request Access” link on the Create Post page should:

Use the same underlying Request Access logic as the Settings page (shared code if appropriate).

Either:

Open the correct Request Access flow (API call / modal / link-sharing access), and

Show a success confirmation,

Or show a friendly error if something fails — not a broken or raw error screen.

✅ What you MUST do (ONLY this):

Find where the “Request Access” button and link are implemented:

On Settings page (link share section)

On Create Post page

Wire them to the correct existing Request Access logic:

Use whatever Request Access handler / function / API the app already has (do NOT invent a new backend or new route if one exists).

Ensure both:

Settings page button

Create Post page link
call the proper handler and handle the result.

Add basic success + error handling (if missing):

On success: show a confirmation (toast, alert, or inline message) using the project’s existing pattern.

On failure: show a simple human-friendly message (e.g., “Could not send access request. Please try again.”) instead of a blank or broken screen.

Keep all other behavior exactly the same:

Do NOT change any other buttons, toggles, or flows in Settings or Create Post.

Do NOT change navigation, auth, or permissions logic beyond what is strictly needed for Request Access.

❌ Hard constraints — DO NOT:

Do NOT change any database schema, Supabase tables, or backend routes other than wiring to existing ones.

Do NOT refactor, rename, or reformat unrelated code or components.

Do NOT modify other features (posts, prayers, notifications, daily verse, profile, donations, etc.).

Do NOT change any UI layout or styling except if absolutely required to show the success/error message for this button/link.
