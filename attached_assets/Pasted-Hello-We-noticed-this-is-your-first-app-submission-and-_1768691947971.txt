Guideline 1.2 - Safety - User-Generated Content

We found in our review that your app includes user-generated content but does not have all the required precautions. Apps with user-generated content must take specific steps to moderate content and prevent abusive behavior.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, please revise your app to implement the following precautions:

- A mechanism for users to block abusive users. Blocking should also notify the developer of the inappropriate content and should remove it from the user's feed instantly.

Guideline 3.1.1 - Business - Payments - In-App Purchase

We noticed that your app allows users to contribute donations to the development of your app with a mechanism other than in-app purchase. Although these donations may be optional, they must use in-app purchase since they are associated with receiving digital content or services.

Apps on the United States storefront may link out to the default browser, using buttons, external links, or other calls to action, for payment mechanisms other than in-app purchase. To learn more, see the News post on Apple Developer. For storefronts where there are not alternative options for qualifying apps, the app must use in-app purchase.

Next Steps

Revise the app to use in-app purchase to pay for this type of transaction or remove these transactions from the app.
