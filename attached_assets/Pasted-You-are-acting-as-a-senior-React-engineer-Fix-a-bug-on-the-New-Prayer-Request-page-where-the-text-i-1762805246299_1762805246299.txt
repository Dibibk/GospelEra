Fix a bug on the New Prayer Request page where the text input boxes accept only the first character and then lose focus on mobile or web.

Context

Project: Gospel Era app (React + Vite/Next + Tailwind + Supabase).

Issue: On the New Prayer Request page, whenever a user types into any text field (title, description, etc.), the field takes the first character but then loses focus or clears.

The same issue existed earlier on the Home page and was already fixed there — apply that same fix pattern here.

Instructions

Locate all input fields on the New Prayer Request page (e.g., <input>, <textarea>, <TextField>, etc.).

Identify and fix the root cause using this checklist:

❌ Input has unstable key that changes as user types (e.g., key={value} or dynamic key).
✅ Replace with a stable key (like key="prayerTitle" or a fixed ID).

❌ Component re-initializes form state on every render via useEffect(() => setState(defaults), [state]).
✅ Limit the initialization to useEffect(..., []).

❌ Input switches components or unmounts/remounts on every keystroke.
✅ Keep one component mounted; just update its value prop.

❌ Controlled/uncontrolled mismatch (value sometimes undefined).
✅ Ensure value={state.field || ""}.

❌ autoFocus or conditional rendering steals focus on change.
✅ Remove or guard focus logic.

Ensure all inputs use controlled components:

const [form, setForm] = useState({ title: "", message: "" });

<input
  value={form.title}
  onChange={(e) => setForm({ ...form, title: e.target.value })}
/>
<textarea
  value={form.message}
  onChange={(e) => setForm({ ...form, message: e.target.value })}
/>


Test manually:

Type multiple characters without losing focus.

Verify the input value persists while typing.

No console warnings about controlled/uncontrolled inputs.

Mobile keyboard stays active during continuous typing.

Deliverables
