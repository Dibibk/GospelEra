There are two issues I need you to fix.
Fix ONLY these two issues and do NOT change anything else in the project.

1) Login credentials not remembered on phone after logout

Problem:

On my phone (iOS/Android), when I log out and then go back to the login screen, my login credentials are not pre-filled, even if I previously chose to remember them (or the app is expected to remember them).

I stay logged in fine during a session, but after logging out, the email/username is not saved on the login form.

Desired behavior:

When the user logs in with the “remember” behavior enabled (or whatever the intended design is):

The app should store the user’s login identifier (email/username) in persistent client storage that works on mobile (Capacitor Preferences / AsyncStorage / local storage, using whatever pattern the project already uses).

After logout, when the login screen is shown again:

The email/username field should be auto-filled from that stored value.

The “Remember me” checkbox (if present) should reflect that it is enabled.

For security, do NOT store the raw password in plain text. If there is no secure password-remember pattern already implemented, only remember the email/username.

If the user logs in without “remember” turned on, do not store or pre-fill anything.

What to do:

Find the login form and any existing “Remember me” or credential persistence logic.

Implement or fix the code that:

Saves the email/username to persistent storage on successful login when remember is enabled.

Reads it back and auto-fills the field when the login screen loads after logout.

Make sure this works on iOS and Android without breaking existing web behavior.

Do NOT change any backend APIs, auth provider configuration, or unrelated screens.
Only touch the minimal code related to remembering and pre-filling login credentials.

2) Saved Posts do not show profile pictures for users who have pictures

Problem:

In the Saved Posts list, posts from users who do have a profile picture are not showing their avatar.

Instead, a generic placeholder or no image is shown.

On other screens (for example main feed or comments), those same users’ profile pictures may display correctly.

Desired behavior:

In the Saved Posts list:

If the post’s author has a profile picture set, show that profile picture.

If the author does not have a profile picture, show the standard default avatar used elsewhere in the app.

The behavior should be consistent with whatever logic is used for profile pictures on the main feed or other lists.

What to do:

Locate the component that renders the Saved Posts list.

Fix the avatar logic so that:

It uses the same user/profile image field and fallback behavior that is already used on the main posts feed.

It properly loads the image URL from the user profile and shows the default avatar when missing.

Do not change layout, text, or other functionality in Saved Posts—only the avatar display.

Do NOT change database schema, APIs, or any other screens.
Only fix the avatar display logic for Saved Posts.

Hard constraints — for both issues:

Do NOT refactor or reformat unrelated files.

Do NOT modify any other features (posts, prayers, notifications, daily verse, donations, settings, etc.).

Keep changes as small and focused as possible.
