Fix ONLY the Saved Posts click behavior and do NOT change anything else in the project.

🧩 Problem

On the Saved Posts page:

When I click a saved post, the app takes me to Home, but it does not scroll to or stay on the original post.

It just goes to the top of Home instead of showing the correct post the user clicked.

🎯 Required Behavior

When a user clicks a saved post:

Navigate to the Home page

Automatically scroll to or focus/highlight the original post corresponding to that saved post’s ID

Do NOT open a separate Post Detail screen

Do NOT reload or break the feed

Only show the correct post in its natural position inside the home feed

✅ What you MUST do (ONLY this):
1. Pass correct post ID when clicking a saved post

From the Saved Posts list → send the postId to the Home page.

2. Modify the Home feed to accept an optional “focusPostId” (or similar)

After navigation, Home should:

Wait for the feed to load

Find the DOM element/component for that post

Scroll into view

Optionally highlight it briefly (if the app already supports highlighting)

3. Keep EVERYTHING else unchanged

Do NOT modify:

Post details page

Save/unsave logic

Home feed structure

Database tables

API routes

Styling beyond what is needed to highlight the post (if highlighting exists)

4. Remove or fix 3-dots menu

If the 3-dots icon on Saved Posts has no functions, remove it.

If there are existing functions intended for it, wire them correctly.

Do NOT add new features.

❌ Hard Rules — Do NOT:

Do NOT create new pages or redesign routing

Do NOT change the home feed logic except adding scroll-to-post

Do NOT refactor unrelated components

Do NOT change backend code

Do NOT alter any other feature (prayers, profile, notifications, settings, etc.)

✅ What I want returned:

List of files changed

Minimal code diff for:

Saved Posts click handler

Home page scroll-to-post logic

3-dots menu (fixed or removed)

A manual test checklist:

Save a post

Go to Saved Posts

Click the saved post

Home page appears and scrolls to the correct post

Confirm 3-dots behavior as implemented
