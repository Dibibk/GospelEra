On the Notifications screen:

For some items (example: “Atxdukes commented on ‘Praise God, I got healed’”), the left icon shows as a blue box with a “?”.

For other notifications (example: “Ridibi commented on ‘Jesus’”), the icon is a proper comment bubble (this is the correct one, as shown in my screenshot).

Desired behavior:

For all comment notifications, use the same comment bubble icon that is already used for “Ridibi commented on ‘Jesus’”.

Do NOT show the blue “?” placeholder anywhere on the Notifications list.

If a user has a real profile picture and the design is to show avatars instead of the comment bubble, follow the existing design rules consistently:

Either show the user’s avatar, or

Show the standard comment icon — but never the broken “?” graphic.

What to do:

Find where notification list items are rendered (Notifications screen component).

Fix the icon logic so that:

Comment notifications always show the intended icon (comment bubble) or avatar according to existing design.

No notification ever falls back to the blue “?” box.

Make the smallest possible change; do not alter layout, text, or other parts of the UI.

🧩 Problem 2 – Notification when a prayer is marked as “Prayed”

I need to confirm and, if missing, implement notifications for when someone changes a prayer’s status to “Prayed”.

Requirements:

Check whether a notification is already implemented for this event:

When a user taps the “Prayed” / “I prayed” button (or equivalent) on a prayer,

Does the owner/creator of that prayer receive a notification?

If this notification is NOT implemented:

Add a new notification using the existing notification system (do NOT create new tables or a separate system).

Use the same pattern as other notifications (e.g., “X commented on Y”) to:

Create a notification record in the notifications table.

Trigger any existing push notification logic, if applicable.

The notification text can be something like:

“{username} prayed for your request ‘{prayer title}’”

Show this new notification on the Notifications screen like any other item, with a consistent icon (e.g., the same prayer/hand or comment-style icon used elsewhere).

If this notification already exists but is broken:

Fix the wiring so that:

It is created whenever a user marks a prayer as “Prayed”.

It appears correctly in the Notifications list.

Any existing push notification logic also works.

Do NOT change:

The underlying “Prayed” business logic (counts, prayer impact, etc.).

Any other notification types or screens.

❌ Hard constraints — DO NOT:

Do NOT change database schema or add new tables. Use the existing notifications structure.

Do NOT modify unrelated routes, features, or screens (posts, profile, prayers list, saved posts, donations, settings, etc.).

Do NOT refactor or reformat large sections of code; keep changes minimal and focused.

Do NOT change the wording or behavior of other notification types.

✅ When you’re done, show me:

A list of all files you changed.

The minimal code diffs or updated snippets related ONLY to:

Fixing the incorrect notification icon.

Adding/fixing the notification when a prayer is marked as “Prayed”.

How to trigger a comment notification and verify the correct icon.
