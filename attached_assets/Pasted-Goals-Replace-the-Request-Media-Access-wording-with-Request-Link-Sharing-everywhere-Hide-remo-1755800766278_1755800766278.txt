Goals

Replace the “Request Media Access” wording with “Request Link Sharing” everywhere.

Hide/remove all image & video upload controls/buttons/routes.

Add YouTube link (optional) field to post/prayer composers.

Reuse the existing approval pipeline (moderation_status + Admin review) for links.

1) Copy changes (UI)

Replace button/label text globally:

From: “Request Media Access”

To: “Request Link Sharing”

Help text under the dashed box: “You can request permission to share YouTube links. We don’t host uploads.”

If there’s a Settings section, rename “Media Uploads” → “Link Sharing”.

2) Hide image/video uploads

In all composers (post, prayer, comment, profile):

Hide/remove the upload dropzone, icons, and any “Add Photos & Videos” CTA.

Remove the upload button and any references in tooltips/empty states.

Guard server routes:

/s3/* or /gcs/* endpoints should return 410 Gone with { code: 'MEDIA_UPLOADS_DISABLED' }.

Remove any visible “Upload” buttons from menus or modals.

3) Add YouTube link field

In Post and Prayer composers, insert a new optional input:

Label: “YouTube link (optional)”

Placeholder: “https://youtu.be/VIDEOID
 or https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID”

Validation:

Allow only hosts: youtube.com, www.youtube.com, youtu.be.

Normalize to canonical: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEOID (keep t if present).

Inline error on invalid: “Only standard YouTube links are allowed.”

On blur/submit, call existing verify helper (or add /embeds/verify if missing) and show success/error state.

4) DB / model (reuse existing approval flow)

Ensure posts and prayer_requests have embed_url text (nullable). If missing, add a migration.

When a link is present, create the record with:

embed_url = canonical link

moderation_status = 'pending' (use your existing moderation column)

moderation_reason = null

Use existing Admin moderation UI to review:

Show rows with embed_url IS NOT NULL AND moderation_status='pending'

Approve → moderation_status='approved'

Reject → moderation_status='rejected', set moderation_reason

5) Rendering

In feed & detail pages:

If embed_url present AND moderation_status='approved' → render <EmbedCard> (YouTube iframe).

If pending → show author-only pill “Under review”.

If rejected → author-only banner “Link rejected: {reason}” + Edit link action.

6) Cleanup of old media UI

Remove any references to “Photos & Videos” from:

Buttons, helper text, empty states, and tooltips.

Quick actions / FABs.

The dashed placeholder box in your screenshot should now show only:

A small lock icon and the text “Request Link Sharing” (if you keep the request flow), or hide the box entirely if you don’t offer requests yet.

7) Tests to update

Remove/skip tests that exercise /s3/* or /gcs/*.

Add tests:

Valid YouTube links accepted and saved with moderation_status='pending'.

Non-YouTube links rejected with inline error.

Approved links render <EmbedCard>; pending/rejected show the correct badges/banners.

8) Copy (final UI strings)

Button: “Request Link Sharing”

Helper text: “Share YouTube links (no uploads). Links are reviewed before appearing publicly.”

Field label: “YouTube link (optional)”

Invalid link: “Only YouTube links are allowed.”

Pending pill: “Under review”

Rejected banner: “Link rejected — please update and resubmit.”
