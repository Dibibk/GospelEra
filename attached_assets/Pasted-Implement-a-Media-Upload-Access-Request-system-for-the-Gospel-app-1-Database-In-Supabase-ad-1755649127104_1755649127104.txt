Implement a "Media Upload Access Request" system for the Gospel app.

1. Database:
- In Supabase, add to `profiles` table: 
  - `media_enabled boolean default false`.
- Create new table `media_requests`:
  - `id bigserial primary key`
  - `user_id uuid references profiles(id) on delete cascade`
  - `status text default 'pending' check (status in ('pending','approved','denied'))`
  - `reason text`
  - `created_at timestamptz default now()`
- RLS:
  - Users can insert a request for their own user_id and select only their rows.
  - Admins can select all, update all.

2. Backend/Helpers:
- Create `src/lib/mediaRequests.ts`:
  - `requestMediaAccess(reason: string)`: inserts row into `media_requests`.
  - `listMyRequests(userId)`: returns user’s own requests.
  - `listAllRequests()`: admin only, returns all requests with user info.
  - `approveMediaRequest(requestId, adminId)`: updates request.status='approved' and sets `profiles.media_enabled=true`.
  - `denyMediaRequest(requestId, adminId)`: sets request.status='denied'.

3. Client/User flow:
- In `/settings` page, add **Media Sharing** section.
  - If `profile.media_enabled=false`, show a card:
    Title: "Media Upload Access"
    Text: "By default, media sharing are restricted to protect the community. If you’d like to share gospel-centered images or videos, you can request access below."
    Button: **Request Access** → opens modal.
    Modal: textarea "Reason for request", Submit button → calls `requestMediaAccess(reason)`, then shows confirmation toast.
  - If request pending: show banner "Your request is under review."
  - If denied: show banner "Your request was denied. You may still post text content."
  - If approved: user now has `profile.media_enabled=true`, so uploaders appear as normal.

- In Post/Prayer/Comment composers:
  - Hide media uploader if `!profile.media_enabled`.
  - If hidden, show link “Request media access” that routes to `/settings#media`.

4. Admin flow:
- Add route `/admin/media-requests`.
  - Table listing all requests: user_id → username, reason, created_at, current status.
  - Buttons: Approve / Deny.
    - Approve: sets `status='approved'` and flips user.profile.media_enabled=true.
    - Deny: sets `status='denied'`.
  - Show toast on action.
  - Approved users immediately see upload option next time they visit.

5. Server enforcement:
- In `/server/s3/presign-upload`, before signing:
  - Check `profiles.media_enabled`.
  - If false → return 403 `{ code:'NO_MEDIA_PERMISSION' }`.
  - Enforce also on video uploads (later may add subscription check).

6. UI/Copy (gospel tone):
- Request card copy: 
  "Media sharing are a privilege granted to trusted community members to keep our app Christ-centered. If you feel led to share gospel images or videos, you can request access. Every upload must honor Jesus and align with our guidelines."
- Denied state copy:
  "At this time, your request for media sharing was not approved. You can continue to post text prayers and scriptures, which remain the heart of our community."
