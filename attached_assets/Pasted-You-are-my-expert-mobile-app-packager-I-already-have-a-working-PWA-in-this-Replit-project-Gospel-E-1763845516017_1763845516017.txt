You are my expert mobile app packager.
I already have a working PWA in this Replit project (Gospel Era).

Goal:
Wrap this existing PWA using Capacitor so I can build Android and iOS apps for the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
Do NOT rewrite my app. Only add what’s needed to integrate Capacitor cleanly.

1. Analyze the current project

Look at package.json and:

Identify the build command (e.g., "build")

Identify the build output folder (e.g., dist or build)

Tell me which folder you will use as webDir for Capacitor.

2. Install Capacitor

Add Capacitor dependencies:

npm install @capacitor/core @capacitor/cli


Then initialize Capacitor with a suitable app name and app ID, using the correct webDir based on this project (update webDir accordingly):

npx cap init "Gospel Era" "com.gospelera.app" --web-dir=dist


If the build output folder is NOT dist, use the correct one from this project and adjust the command and config accordingly.

3. Configure capacitor.config / capacitor.config.ts

Create or update the Capacitor config file so that:

appName is "Gospel Era"

appId is "com.gospelera.app"

webDir matches the actual build output folder from this project.

Make sure the config file is valid for Capacitor v5+.

4. Add Android and iOS platforms

Add both platforms to the project:

npm install @capacitor/android @capacitor/ios
npx cap add android
npx cap add ios


This should create:

android/ folder (Android Studio project)

ios/ folder (Xcode project)

Do NOT modify my React/PWA source code beyond what is strictly required for Capacitor.

5. Build + Sync flow

Update package.json scripts (if needed) to add a clear flow, for example:

"scripts": {
  "build": "...existing build command...",
  "cap:sync": "npx cap sync",
  "cap:android": "npm run build && npx cap sync android",
  "cap:ios": "npm run build && npx cap sync ios"
}


Make sure the steps to produce a build are:

npm run build

npx cap sync

Then open android/ in Android Studio and ios/ in Xcode locally.

6. Verify everything

Run a build inside Replit and make sure there are no errors from Capacitor.

Confirm that:

capacitor.config.* is correctly pointing to the build folder

android/ and ios/ projects are generated

Give me a short summary at the end with:

The build command (npm run ...)

The webDir value used

The folders I need to download/open in Android Studio and Xcode to continue publishing to Play Store and App Store.

Do all file edits and commands directly for me.
When you’re done, explain the exact steps I should run from the Replit shell to build and sync (for Android and iOS).
