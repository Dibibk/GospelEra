There is a bug on the Prayer Details page related to the “I will pray” button.
Fix ONLY this issue and do NOT change anything else in the project.

🧩 Problem

On the Prayer Details page, when I click the “I will pray” button:

The UI does not update immediately.

The button state / count / UI still looks unchanged.

If I log out and log back in, then I see the updated state (so the backend is working, but the UI is not refreshing).

🎯 Desired Behavior

When the user taps “I will pray” on the Prayer Details page:

The request should be sent to the existing backend/API as it is now.

After a successful response, the Prayer Details UI should:

Immediately reflect the new state (e.g., show that the user has committed to pray, update any count/badge/text).

The button text/state should update without needing a full app restart or re-login.

If the request fails, show a simple error message instead of leaving the user confused.

✅ What you MUST do (ONLY this):

Find the “I will pray” button logic on the Prayer Details page:

Locate the Prayer Details component.

Find the handler/function that runs when “I will pray” is clicked.

Update the UI immediately after success:

After a successful API call / Supabase update:

Update the local React state / query cache / data model used by the Prayer Details page.

Make sure the component re-renders so:

The button changes to the correct “already praying” state (or whatever the design expects).

Any related counts (like “people who will pray”) are updated.

You may:

Either mutate the local state directly, OR

Trigger a refetch of the prayer data for this page, depending on how the rest of the app is structured.

Do NOT change anything else:

Do NOT change the backend route, database schema, or business logic for “I will pray”.

Do NOT change the behavior of prayer lists, My Prayers page, or other screens.

Do NOT refactor or reformat unrelated code.

Only touch the minimal code needed to make the Prayer Details page update right after clicking “I will pray”.
