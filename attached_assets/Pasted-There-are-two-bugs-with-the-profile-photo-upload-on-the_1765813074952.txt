There are two bugs with the profile photo upload on the Profile page.
Fix ONLY these issues and do NOT change anything else in the project.

Problems:

When I upload some photos that don’t meet the required constraints (file type / size / resolution), the upload silently fails.

The photo is not uploaded.

The user gets no error message.

When I upload a valid photo that does qualify, it saves correctly in the backend, but the Profile page does not refresh the image immediately.

It looks like nothing happened.

If I close and reopen the app, I see the new picture.

I want to fix both of these on the Profile page only.

✅ What you MUST do (and ONLY this):

Add clear validation + error messaging before/when uploading:

In the Profile page component where profile photos are uploaded:

Validate the selected file for:

Allowed formats (e.g. JPG, PNG, HEIC – use whatever the app already expects).

Maximum file size (use the existing limit if one already exists; otherwise, pick a reasonable size like 5 MB).

Any existing resolution or ratio constraints used by the backend (if already enforced server-side).

If the photo does not qualify:

Do NOT attempt the upload.

Show a clear, friendly error message to the user, such as:

“This photo can’t be used. Please upload a JPG or PNG under 5 MB.”

Or match any existing error style in the app.

Make sure the error is visible near the upload control and cleared when the user selects a new file.

Refresh the profile picture immediately after a successful upload:

After the upload API call succeeds:

Update the local state so the new profile image is shown right away without closing/reopening the app.

This can be either:

Using the URL returned from the upload response, OR

Refetching the current user/profile info and updating the avatar field.

Ensure there is no stale caching of the old avatar (e.g., append a cache-busting query param if needed like ?t=${Date.now()} when setting the image src).

Keep behavior consistent between platforms:

The fix should work on:

iOS app

Android app

Web, if the same Profile page is used

But do not introduce any platform-specific behavior unless it’s required by the existing code pattern.

❌ Hard constraints — DO NOT:

Do NOT change any backend routes, database schema, or storage buckets.

Do NOT modify any unrelated UI components or screens.

Do NOT refactor, rename, or reformat files beyond the minimal changes needed.

Do NOT alter auth logic, navigation, or any other feature (posts, prayers, notifications, donations, etc.).
